Guide_Me is some thing like a helping web app from which many of the students like us can fulfill their dreams 
without any comlaints.................... Guide_Meâ€™s main intension is to help out the students from their wrong decisions and

were to get joined and what course we have to take for those people  this app helps alot in this app the student can find easily 
what course he/she would like to take and where to go for their furthur studies..... the students can easily take up their 
courses and enjoy their studies and can do many miracles in the the present compitative world......

         In this app i have been used five tools they are:  

* Dreamviewer
 
* JavaScript

* JSP

* MySQL

* Apache tomcat

      Dreamveiwer is used to design the web pages in the html...using java script i have been validated the pages..... 
JavaScript is used write the validation code in html. JSP pages can be used in combination with servlets that handle the 
business logic, the model supported by Java servlet template engines. MySQL is used for adding the databases.. Apache tomcat is 
used to deploy your Java Servlets and JSPs. So in your Java project you can build your WAR (short for Web ARchive) file, and 
just drop it in the deploy directory in tomcat.......
